DLM-DOT-BIN
===========

This is a collection of scripts that help me do things in my daily life. I'm putting them on GitHub on the outside chance that they're of use to anybody else.

Note that these files have only been tested on my machine: Macbook Pro running OSX 10.10 as of 2015.02.05. Use at your own risk - I'd recommend knowing a bit about BASH scripting. [This](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) is a fantastic guide.

Also note: many/most of these scripts assume that they're located in `$HOME/.bin/`, and that `$HOME/.bin` is in your path.
